The code has been designed to run on Purdue Research Computing Clusters. It may not work as-is in your system. Here are a few tips to troubleshoot compiling: 

* The code requires the PyStan library and GCC compiler. Visualization is completed with Arviz, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
* The code runs in parallel using the stanwound.sub file (you will need to configure your Conda environment with the appropriate packages installed)
